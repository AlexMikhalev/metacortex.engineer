- **Reading non-fiction book**: you are not reading the book, but you are extracting knowledge from the book: electronic or printed medium
- **Watching learning video**: extracting knowledge from the video medium
- **Reading blog/article**: extracting knowledge from blog or article

#### Why this framing is important?

- It’s [mental] work (even if it’s enjoyable activity)
- work requires [enabling capabilities]: infrastructure, office, team (or lack of distraction), tools. Popcorn would not do if you are going to take notes, pen and paper may be better. Or YiNote extension.
- **Goal**. Why do you spend time on it? Knowledge is a perishable item, how are you going to apply it?

So there are two parts:

1. We extract knowledge
2. We apply knowledge

Stay tuned for more on the topic
