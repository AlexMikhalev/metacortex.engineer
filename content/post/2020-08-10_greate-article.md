Greate article! I wish I found it earlier: I am on final legs of configuring gentoo/glusterfs (over sd cards, fast usb sticks and slow usb drives)Â , consul, nomad. I would like to use your PiHole setup, but how do you configure your router if pihole can be dynamically deployed using nomad job? Do you pin IP address somehow?
