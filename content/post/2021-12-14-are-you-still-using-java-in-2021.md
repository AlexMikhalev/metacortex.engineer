# Are you still using Java in 2021?

Bad guys are coming for you:

One more reason to stop using Java in 2021 [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/12/on-the-log4j-vulnerability.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/12/on-the-log4j-vulnerability.html) use Rust instead, itâ€™s [Greener ](https://medium.com/@loraxman/rust-a-green-language-for-21st-century-9935303db91f)and [more sustainable.](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-12-06-love-for-rust-at-reinvent/)

Seriously, can anyone present a compelling reason to start a new project in Java? Other than maintaining legacy software.

Mind though: in the past for any software written in Java I could faster, cheaper more memory efficient product in another language, with two exceptions: Drools and Camunda, although this gap is [closing](https://github.com/bpxe/bpxe).
