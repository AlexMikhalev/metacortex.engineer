Prior to starting in my previous employment — Shopitize Ltd, I was reseacher for about 8 years and I didn’t manage anyone, but myself. Now I find myself in charge of 35 people spread into 4 different countries. What do you do to get help? Call your mate.

So I picked up phone and called [Maxim Dorofeev](https://procrastinatology.com/2020/05/15/the-jedi-techniques-of-problem-solving/) who since than went to write 2 books and became well known public speaker. My question to him was: for the last 8 years I was researcher and didn’t manage anyone but myself, now I have team of 35 in 4 different countries, what would you recommend to learn about best approach in Agile. His recommendation was — here are 3 videos about structuring team, performance metrics and retrospectives each 45 minutes long.

My answer: I don’t have time to watch 3 45 minutes videos And he responded with: “All right I know this symptom, here 3 15 minute videos on personal productivity” (and it took me 6 months to watch it 🙂).

#### Method

Have a **single** Todo list similar to GTD (today, this week, someday), but most important — spell out your tasks so you can do it with your brain switched off. Why is it more important than quadrant: urgent/important? Between urgent and important task, the brain selects next understandable task, which may fall back to facebook pull to refresh, check cricket scores, eating, sleeping or watching TV if it didn’t find the one in todo list. This is why flagging email as todo is counter productive — it may contain multiple tasks and you have to re-read to process it.

Have one **single** todo list: personal and work should be in one = “don’t forget the milk” shall be part of the same todo. The amount of brain fuel is limited, more your spend in the beginning of the day less you will have in a day and brain fuel is not equal to energy. Remembering requires brain fuel, which is why use todo list and avoid remembering whenever possible.

Illiminate distraction and manage your focus time — disable notification, I use “pomodoro technique” when I can (limited so recently, jira is not accessible from my pomodoro app) — 25 minutes work on timer. Forces you to do first part — spell out task so you can pick it up and finish in 20 minutes.

Another trick I use — process inbox at scheduled time not the first thing in the morning, decide what you want to accomplish today first.

[https://maxdone.micromiles.co/services/login](https://maxdone.micromiles.co/services/login "https://maxdone.micromiles.co/services/login") — app I use for todo list, my flow have a dairly and weekly checklists as per technique above.

The technique called Inbox Zero, I have zero emails in mailbox, although you don’t have to be psyhopatic about it.

One important point is personal knowledge management:” thoughts fly swatter”, if you have a thought, write it down in mind map or on piece of paper. Don’t hold it — brain fuel is limited !, review it weekly and build a connections, more on it latter.

#### Collegue (DW) comment:

DW few things jump out:

1. Write stuff down and get it out of your head. I do this partly because I don’t trust my own memory, but as you say this also clears “bandwidth” to focus on tasks. I switched to doing all of this electronically (currently using OneNote, previously just draft emails to myself) a while ago, as paper is unsearchable / unorganisable mess (at least for me)
2. Daily / weekly to-do lists. I do a daily task list at the beginning of the day (including personal / admin things) and have an ongoing key activities / task list which i review / refresh each week. I find this gives the balance of near term focus and progress within a day whilst keeping view of longer lived activities

My answer: Your first point sometimes called exocortex and sometimes collaborative knowledge maangement! And there are number of tools like notion.so, obsydian.md and roam research who strive to create state of the art in that area, we will see more coming and I will write more about in a few days, the wold is getting more and more complex every day and we need to have a way to handle this complexity.

#### Why is it important for Agile team?

One may ask: I missed it how is it connected to working/leading the agile team. Firstly you start with you own performance and getting on top of you own things — there are many people, who even on the top of organisation can’t be on top of their mailbox, secondly if you knows how you own brain functions, then you can give a clear, concise and understandable tasks to your own team, this is where military 5Wand H comes into play. Check your team backlog, can a random team member pick up task from the backlog and process it without talking to anyone else?
