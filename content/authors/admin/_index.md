Experienced Technology Leader and Innovator. I am a systems thinker with a deep understanding of technology and a methodological approach to innovation. Over the last 20 years, I held multiple engineering, academic and leadership positions. I have a  systematic approach to innovation, which allows me to innovate and inspire others to innovate: for example, in 2018, my team build a "blockchain-inspired" distributed system which resulted in the first technology patent in the history of Nationwide Building Society. I have deep knowledge and interests in data privacy, synthetic data, distributed data and natural language processing/search engines, sensors, wired and wireless networks. My unique combination of skills allows me to take novel ideas from inception into production.
