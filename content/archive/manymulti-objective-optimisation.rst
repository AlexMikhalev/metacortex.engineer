Last week I went to the lecture on Evolutionary Algorithms and Multi
Objective optimisation, which my friend [Dr Evan
Hughes]("http://www.evanhughes.org" Dr Evan Hughes) taught as part of
much larger course ("Sensors and Data fusion?"). It is very interesting
course and I wish I had an opportunity to listen to it earlier - the
earlier the better. I really like the examples of the problems shown and
absolutely amazed by some of the examples. One of the "difficult"
objective functions below. Is anyone who would like to try to find
maximum?
