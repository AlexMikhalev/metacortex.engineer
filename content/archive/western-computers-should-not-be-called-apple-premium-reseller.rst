From now on `Western computers`_ do not exists for me:

I bought iPad 32 Gb from them 24 February for my wife's birthday and
within 4 days iPad became 100 pounds cheaper. Apple main store (online
or retail)

provides refund of these 100 pounds for anyone who bought iPad two weeks
prior to announcement of iPad 2, but it's up to resellers to make
decision about such purchase and Western Computers decided do not
provide same level of customer care as apple main store.

So, any reason to buy from Apple reseller in the future, especially from
Western Computers, when you can buy iPads and Macs from Tescos, Curries
even cheaper?
