I am a bit fed up with MT, I looked at MT5 and as usual was seriously
annoyed by MT backup behavior: I attempted to recover backup from mt 4
into clean mt 5 and hit usual wall with schema mismatch error. I believe
recovery should work, no matter what. It should attempt to recover most
of backed up data, even with error message.
And if I need to mess with database dumps and scripts, I am ready to
move from MT.
Currently my choice is limited to:
Wordpress - most of the people I read use it. Latex plugin works out of
the box and MT import from text. Cons - I am sick of PHP code and if I
need to hack it, I will be in seriously bad mood.
Jekill - can use git/hg for versions, I bet my computer is better suited
for publishing latex with mixed html then server. Static pages
generated. Cons - Ruby, I can't say I know ruby, but I can hack the
code.
Golbard - same as jekill but in python. I am pretty confident with
python, but I will have to write movable type import.
