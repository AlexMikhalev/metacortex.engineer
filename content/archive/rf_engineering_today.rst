I have a brand new cool piece of kit `Anritsu`_ MS2691A with optional
`signal generator`_ inside. Apart from playing with it for the last two
weeks, we spend half of the day with my prof trying to get the thing
working.
You will be surprised to know that in order to understand how modern kit
works you need additional Markoni 2300 signal generator and Tektronic
125 MHz oscilloscope.
Nice. Time spread for equipment is huge, Tektronic being dated back to
fifty years.
