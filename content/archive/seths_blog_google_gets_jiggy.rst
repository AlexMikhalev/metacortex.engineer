"It is not what we include but exclude make us different."
I was dreaming about this feature for a while and google made it for me.
When I am looking for radar I don't want Christina Aguilera radar, but
proper military radar. Now I have a power to ban it from my search
results. Looking forward to this feature on flickr's tags search and if
yahoo would be lazy will have to write it myself.
