Definition: We say that a vector of decision variables $ \\hat
x^{\*} \\in F$ is Pareto optimal if there does not exist another $
\\hat x \\in F$ such that $ f(\\hat x) \\le f(\\hat x^{\*})$ for
all $ i = 1, \\hdots k $ and $ f\_{j}(\\hat x)< f\_{j}(\\hat
x)$ for at least one j. In words, this deﬁnition says that $ \\hat
x^{\*}$ is Pareto optimal if there exists no feasible vector of decision
variables $ \\hat x^{\*} \\in F$ which would decrease some
criterion without causing a simultaneous increase in at least one other
criterion. Unfortunately, this concept almost always gives not a single
solution, but rather a set of solutions called the Pareto optimal set.
The vectors $ \\hat x^{\*}$ corresponding to the solutions included
in the Pareto optimal set are called nondominated. The plot of the
objective functions whose nondominated vectors are in the Pareto optimal
set is called the Pareto front.
