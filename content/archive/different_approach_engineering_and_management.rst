I found interesting posts `here`_ and  `here1`_  and was surprised by the
difference in approach between blog posts and this `news`_.
On one stage we have a developer, who is testing modern frameworks in
several programming languages in order to choose one for his new
project.
On another we have software company, buying off the shelf framework and
releasing project with major design flaws. One would assume that
software developing company should have at least one software architect,
should they?
Listen to sales pitch, but test before your buy. Don't make your
decision just based on sales pitch. I like to commit to something before
testing, but I hope I can force myself sometime.
