Most of the links on blogging using Blogging bundle from Textmate are
now outdated or missed, so here we go

\* Find where your mt-xmplrpc.cgi

\* Go to Blogging bundle -> Setup Blogs

\* Put full URL looking like
http://your\_Username@sci-blog.com/mt-xmlrpc.cgi#your\_BlogID

\* Go to your blog dashboard -> Edit your profile -> Web services
password -> reveal, this is the password which should be used with
Textmate (or Flickr or any other XML RPC web-service)

\* Start a new post in Textmate using blogging bundle or hit fetch post.
It should work now.
