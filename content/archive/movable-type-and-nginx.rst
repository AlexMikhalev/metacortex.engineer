After wasting a lot of time attempting to setup nginx and movable type
configuration together without apache - I am on very memory limited VPS,
I given up and moved everything as before on lighttpd. Movable Type
doesn't work under nginx using fastcgi wrapper or fastcgi dispatcher as
in previous post.
