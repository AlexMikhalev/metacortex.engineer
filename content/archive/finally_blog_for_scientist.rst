I build my own blog, with latex support and action streams mash up:
fetching my activity from different websites like delicious and shared
posts from google reader. Linkedin, facebook, flickr and .mac gallery
integration is also supported, but I didn't hack templates for thumbnail
previews.

If you would like to have a blog with latex, cross posting to lj, but
don't feel like installing your own wordpress, register as a commentor

and then drop me a comment  with desired blog name, so I create blog and
raise your permissions to blog administrator. You can use
http://blogname.sci-blog.com as link to your own blog .
