My main job involves working on projects related to wireless and wired
communications, geolocation and data fusion.

My spare times projects:

\* `Pingfire firefox extension`_ "This is repository for pingfire
extension, official homepage http://www.pingfire.us" -

Some code available on `Bitbucket`_ and `github.com`_, when I will tie
it up.

Also:

\* `LEONET`_ website for LIDAR network

\* `FB app for onebooker.com`_, hosted on Google App engine
