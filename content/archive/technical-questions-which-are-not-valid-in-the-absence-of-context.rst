Technical questions which are not valid in the absence of context

Recently I was asked the number of technical questions which I nearly
failed to answer, not because I don't now the answer, but because I
believe such questions require more information about the context. There
is a common assumption about the default mind frame with MS windows and
C/C+. The assumption doesn't work for me hence I came out as a
non-technical person (I think people who know me a bit will consider it
as a joke, since most of the conversations I came out as a mix of geek
and scientist).

\* Network: what is the difference between port and socket.(I wonder
what is the difference between port and file in \*unix).

\* between process and thread ( not much if you are reading programming
erlang. I wonder what answer will be for QNX or other RTOS)

\* how many ways to copy file from Linux to windows (I know at least +1
to most common: use netcat)
