Color management is turned off by default to prevent subtle color
variations affecting the overall look of web sites. To enable it you
must set gfx.color\_management.enabled to true (via about:config) and
restart Firefox.
This is a cool feature and big step forward for browsers to have a
proper colour palette instead of usual web-safe.
